Yodel for the Algorithmic Search Bing Transition Team<br />
The Algorithmic Search Bing Transition team maniacally focused on desktop and mobile migration of web, image and video search in 40+ global markets from Yahoo’s YST infrastructure to Microsoft’s Bing platform. The Bing Transition Team in Bangalore specifically took complete responsibility for transitioning image and video search to the Bing platform. The Bing transition represents a first-of-its kind partnership for Yahoo!. It is an inherently complex relationship, extremely difficult technical transition and horizontal cross company project unlike any Yahoo! has undertaken in the past. But this team was up to the challenge, delivering with speed and quality. Successful completion of the Algorithmic Search transition in multiple global markets will save $150M+ annually in capital expenditure costs, allowing Yahoo! to focus on global search experience innovation and beyond, both in our core desktop search business, but also importantly across mobile and tablet devices.</p>
