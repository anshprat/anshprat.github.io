<p>Recently I ve been hearing a lot about ipv6. And rather I ve seen the crunch of ipv4 address in real life. And thats not the only reason why I want to forray into ipv6. Its like the hot thing am trying to get my hands on it right now.<br />
So first and foremost I am trying to use ipv6 in my personal space. Maybe setup my home network on ipv6. And move my blog to a ipv6 host. I am looking for a ipv6 webhost service. The two options I ve found first hand are <a href="http://www.he.net/">Hurricane Electric</a> and a VPS provider - <a href="http://www.buildyourvps.com">build your VPS </a>.</p>
<p>Lets just say, this is the first in the series of upcoming posts about my forray into ipv6. Will keep updating things as and when they happen.<br />
Things I want to do.  -<br />
1) Setup up my home network on a high speed wifi (802.11n router)<br />
2) Have a public ipv6 hosted domain.</p>
<p>I guess its time to do what I love.</p>
<p>cheers!<br />
