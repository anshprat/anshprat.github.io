<p>I use my laptop (dell Inspiron 1420) as a server for remote access from office. Even at home, my primary laptop is my mac. I just let my dell run all the time as I don't know when I would need/want to access that from office. </p>
<p>I wanted to enable WOL or Wake Up on Lan so that I could start my laptop from office if required. Even though it says "Wake Up on Lan", it can be started from internet as well.</p>
<p>First place to start was to enable the WOL option in BIOS. And lo.. it wasn't there.. ! So, does my NIC card doesn't support WOL ?</p>
<p>But a quick probe using ethtool showed WOL was indeed supported on my card.</p>
<blockquote><p>[root@mouthwa init.d]# ethtool eth0<br />
Settings for eth0:<br />
        Supported ports: [ TP ]<br />
        Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full<br />
                                100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full<br />
        Supports auto-negotiation: Yes<br />
        Advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full<br />
                                100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full<br />
        Advertised pause frame use: No<br />
        Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes<br />
        Speed: 100Mb/s<br />
        Duplex: Full<br />
        Port: Twisted Pair<br />
        PHYAD: 1<br />
        Transceiver: internal<br />
        Auto-negotiation: on<br />
        MDI-X: Unknown<br />
<strong>        Supports Wake-on: g</strong><br />
        Wake-on: d<br />
        Current message level: 0x000000ff (255)<br />
        Link detected: yes
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the next line, Wake-on: d means that WOl was disabled. To enable WOL, use:</p>
<blockquote><p>
ethtool -s eth0 wol g
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now this change is not persistent, i.e, it will be gone in the next reboot.<br />
So to make it persisten, I put a file in /etc/init.d/</p>
<p>cat /etc/init.d/wol<br />
#!/bin/bash<br />
#wake on lan<br />
ethtool -s eth0 wol g<br />
exit</p>
<p>Do a chmod +x on the file.</p>
<p>Now check which all devices are allowed to wake up your system in the OS:</p>
<blockquote><p>
[root@mouthwa init.d]# cat /proc/acpi/wakeup<br />
Device  S-state   Status   Sysfs node<br />

PBTN      S4    *enabled<br />
MBTN      S5    *disabled
</p></blockquote>
<p>I need to find out which of the above is my NIC card and enable wake up for that.</p>

<p>Notice the 1c.5 in front of my LAN card in the lspci output above. Look for the same number in the /proc/acpi/wakeup and I find that my card is RPC06!</p>
<p>Now to enable the wakeup for my card, a simple echo will do:</p>
<p><code><br />
[root@mouthwa init.d]# echo RP06>/proc/acpi/wakeup<br />
[root@mouthwa init.d]# cat /proc/acpi/wakeup |grep RP06<br />
RP06      S5    *enabled   pci:0000:00:1c.5<br />
</code></p>
<p>So there you are, WOL is enabled!<br />
However, it can wake up only from certain states, not all at the moment.</p>
<p>So, the best way to switch off the laptop so that it can be woken from LAN is</p>
<p>[root@mouthwa init.d]# pm-suspend-hybrid </p>
<p>What it does is that the system does everything it needs to hibernate, but suspends instead of shutting down. This means that your computer can wake up quicker than for<br />
           normal hibernation if you do not run out of power, and you can resume even if you run out of power.<br />
Most of the above was sourced from <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1229783" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the script to wake up from internet.</p>
<p>I got it from <a href="http://www.hackernotcracker.com/2006-04/wol-wake-on-lan-tutorial-with-bonus-php-script.html" target="_blank">here</a>:<br />
http://www.hackernotcracker.com/2006-04/wol-wake-on-lan-tutorial-with-bonus-php-script.html</p>
<p>Also, If you dont want to or dont have a place to run scripts, you can use online services like:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.depicus.com/wake-on-lan/woli.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.depicus.com/wake-on-lan/woli.aspx</a></p>
<p>Ofcourse, you need to know your MAC address, your router address and the subnet.<br />
Keep subnet as 255.255.255.255 in the depicus page if you have one public ip and the router allots private ips using DHCP. (This is true for most of the routers).</p>
<p>And now, I can happily power down my laptop and wake it up when required! #FTW</p>
