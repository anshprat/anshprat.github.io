<p>Some Excerpts:</p>
<p>People in the southern state of Kerala are the heaviest drinkers in India, and sales of alcohol are rising fast. The BBC's Soutik Biswas examines why.<br />
Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in India</p>
<p>Jacob Varghese says he began drinking when he was nine years old, sipping on his father's unfinished whisky and brandy in glass tumblers.</p>
<p>Kerala is India's tippler country. It has the highest per capita consumption - over eight litres (1.76 gallons) per person a year - in the nation, overtaking traditionally hard-drinking states like Punjab and Haryana. </p>
<p>Also, in a strange twist of taste, rum and brandy are the preferred drink in Kerala in a country where whisky outsells every other liquor. </p>
<p>Alcohol helps in giving Kerala's economy a good high - shockingly, more than 40% of revenues for it's annual budget come from booze. </p>
<p>A state-run monopoly sells alcohol - the curiously named Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC) - runs 337 liquor shops, open seven days a week. Each shop caters on average to an astonishing 80,000 clients. </p>
<p>This fiscal year the KSBC is expected to sell $1bn (Â£0.6bn) of alcohol in a state of 30 million people, up from $12m when it took over the retail business in 1984. </p>
<p>Similarly, revenues from alcohol to the state's exchequer have registered a whopping 100% rise over the past four years. </p>
<p>The monopoly is so professionally run that consumers can even send text messages from their phones to a helpline number to record their grievances. </p>
<p>"If we delay opening any of our shops by even five minutes, clients send us text messages saying that they are waiting to buy liquor," says KSBC chief N Shankar Reddy. </p>
<p>That's not all. There are some 600 privately-run bars in the state and more than 5,000 shops selling toddy (palm wine), the local brew. There is also a thriving black market liquor trade.</p>
<p>The jolly and convivial Mr Balakrishnan, 67, says his father "initiated" him into drinking when he was four.</p>
