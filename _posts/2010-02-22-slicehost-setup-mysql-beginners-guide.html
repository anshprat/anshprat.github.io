<p>Ok, so first and foremost about the heading. Its a direct search term that I got on this blog. I realised that even though I answered the query in<a href="http://anshprat.info/2010/02/17/setting-up-your-websiteblog-using-wordpress-on-a-slicehost-slice/"> this post</a>, the user actually never got to see it. My bad!</p>
<p>Ok, assumption 1: You are using Fedora as your server distro. If you are using some other distro, please modify the yum commands as per your distro.<br />
These steps can rather be used to set up a working <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" target="_blank">LAMP</a><br />
Type the following on your terminal<br />
<code><br />
su<br />
yourPasswd<br />
yum install apache mysql mysql-server phpmyadmin<br />
service start mysqld<br />
service start httpd<br />
</code></p>
<p>These will do the basics for you. You still wont be able to access your apache running on your host because of firewall/iptables.</p>
<p>referer to<a href="http://anshprat.info/2010/02/17/setting-up-your-websiteblog-using-wordpress-on-a-slicehost-slice#howto"> this post</a> for further instructions on how to get it all up and running.</p>
