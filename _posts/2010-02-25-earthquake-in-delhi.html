<blockquote><p>The epicentre was NOT Delhi. Probably not even India. I felt the shock wavr run from my foot to toe. #Earthquake
</p></blockquote>
<p>And she is an <a href="http://twitter.com/ikaveri/status/9589074322">experienced one</a> :( :</p>
<blockquote><p>
YES. Im VERY SURE. It was an EARTHQUAKE. Epicentre cant be here. But it was a bad one somewhere. I have felt many in my life Latur, Kashmir.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Though seems it wasnt that huge. People in <a href="http://twitter.com/Naina/status/9589504022">Noida</a>  are saying they didnt feel anything.</p>
<p>Though seems otherwise in <a href="http://twitter.com/mojosanjay/statuses/9589279972">Gurgaon</a><br />
Will keep you updated on it.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Twitter is dying down on earthquake tweets in delhi. Seems it was a small one. Hope all stays well.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2: Apparently it wasn't just Delhi but some in <a href="http://twitter.com/amalikdelhi/status/9590470683">Uttaranchal</a> as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Mild earthquake in Bageshwar Uttaranchal. Some people in South Delhi felt tremors. Seems nothing major.</p></blockquote>
