<p>Mac has a very easy way to change your perl @INC path.<br />
Just append the required directory to the file<br />
/Library/Perl/5.8.8/AppendToPath</p>
<p>Note the version above (5.8.8) may differ for you. To find out your perl version,<br />
type perl -v in the terminal.</p>
<blockquote><p>listsettle-lm:~ anshup$ perl -v</p>
<p>This is perl, v5.8.8 built for darwin-thread-multi-2level<br />
(with 4 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)
</p></blockquote>
