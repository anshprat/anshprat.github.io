<p>Bing has come up with <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/search/archive/2010/03/01/bing-autosuggest-history-repeats-itself-and-that-is-a-good-thing.aspx">a new feature</a> that doesn't exist in the market as of date! It now gives Auto suggests based on your past searches. Google also stores your past searches(if you are logged into google) using <a href="http://google.com/history">web history</a>. Yahoo now seems to be the only safe search engine out there which doesn't seem to be storing users past searches!</p>
<p>As per bing offical blog</p>
<blockquote><p>
 In fact, 44% of non-navigational search sessions last longer than 1 week!  </p></blockquote>
<p>This move might again stir up the Hornets nest of privacy concerns! Lets wait and watch!</p>
