<p>I was trying it out to boot from USB using fedora for a friends laptop. On booting I saw the above error.</p>
<p>And found the answer at:</p>

<p><code>dd if=[name of iso] of=/dev/sdc<br />
</code><br />
NOT /dev/sdc1  and before removing the usb stick type into terminal:</p>
<p><code><br />
sync<br />
eject /dev/sdc<br />
</code></p>
<p>sdc being whatever your usb stick device is<br />
this will ensure that all the data is written to the stick before removal.</p>
<p>Voila! It worked. Like the next comment says in the above post, indeed, so stupid of me :P</p>
