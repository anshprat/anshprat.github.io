<p>This was something that I was looking for a long time and finally found while looking for a completely different thing altogether!<br />
Agreed I always wanted this only for mischief :P Basically what I wanted was to fire up any GUI so that it would show on a remote desktop and not on my local display. clearly I didn't want vnc or ssh -XCYP.</p>
<p>What I needed was this:</p>
<p>ssh -X host<br />
export DISPLAY=:0</p>
<p>and then I can run any gui and it will open on the remote desktop.<br />
would make things look like some hacky mischief ;)</p>
<p>okay, another thing I learnt was how to start and stop gnome screensaver remotely.</p>
<p>so instead of doing a killall -9 screensaver, you can do<br />
gnome-screensaver-command -d</p>
<p>So there are things that are still fun!<br />
Gosh, do I miss college!</p>
