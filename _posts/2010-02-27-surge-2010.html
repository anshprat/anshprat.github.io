<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Update: The results of SURGE 2010, for Non-IITK students, will be declared by the end of March 2010.</span></p>
<p>Its been over two years since I first blogged about <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/surge/">surge</a><a href="http://anshprat.wordpress.com/2008/01/15/surge-2008-iitk/"> 2008</a>. I followed it up with another one on <a href="http://anshprat.wordpress.com/2008/11/15/surge-2009-is-here/">surge 2009</a> after seeing the traffic on that particular post. Here is the info on the series about surge 2010.</p>
<p>First and foremost, What is Surge?</p>
<p>Summer Undergraduate Research Grant for Excellence<br />
SURGE at IIT Kanpur</p>
<p>The Under the Summer Undergraduate Research Grant for Excellence (SURGE) program, undergraduate students from IITK and other participating institutions will undertake short duration, but focused research projects and push their intellectual abilities beyond those driven by the classroom. The duration is 10 weeks from early-May to end-July of each year. Students working at IITK will receive a stipend of Rs.10,000 for the entire 10-week duration; an additional Rs.10,000 Award plus a commendation certificate will be given to those SURGE students who produce exceptional quality research during the 10 weeks. IITK students in overseas institutions will receive a stipend as fixed by the agreement between IITK and the participating institutes.</p>
<p>Surge has added a couple of more foreign institutes to its list in 2010. Now the Universities for SURGE 2010 are California Institute of Technology (<a href="http://www.caltech.edu">http://www.caltech.edu</a>), Ecole Polytechnique (<a href="http://www.polytechnique.edu">http://www.polytechnique.edu</a>), Ecole Centrale de Paris (<a href="http://www.ecp.fr">http://www.ecp.fr</a>) and Rice University (<a href="http://www.rice.edu">http://www.rice.edu</a>).</p>
<p>However the above is available only to IIT-K students.</p>
<p>Surge 2010 has a new feature! People from other colleges can also apply to Surge.  Also, now First year M.Sc/ MA can also apply to Surge. Earlier only B.Tech students of NITs could apply for surge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems that this year's application dates are over :(</p>
<blockquote><p>The completed application form along with the paper copies will be due on/before February 12, 2010.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Students studying in the following colleges are eligible to apply for the SURGE program in 2010 at IIT Kanpur. Please note that students from any department of these colleges can apply to any department at IIT Kanpur.</p>
<p>The SURGE program is open to all students currently in their 2nd year and 3rd year of bachelors (BA/B.Sc/B.E/B.Tech) or 1st year of M.Sc/MA.</p>
<p>Students from all IITs, NITs, IISERs and NISERs are eligible to apply for the SURGE program. In addition, students from the following colleges may also apply.</p></blockquote>
