<p>The Mayans were right! It is the end of the world. The end of the world as we knew it. With the deads of maestros like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Chopra" target="_blank">Yash Chopra</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar" target="_blank">Pandit Ravi Shankar</a>; others like Neil Armstrong, Michael Clarke Duncan, Whitney Houston, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaspal_Bhatti" target="_blank">Jaspa Bhatti</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verghese_Kurien" target="_blank">Verghese Kurien</a>, Dara Singh, A.K Hangal to name a few; it indeed seemed as if they were all being ported away to "2012" themed escape pods/ships. Closer home, where everything seemed "<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/12/24/prime-minister-asks-theek-hai-on-rape-statement/" target="_blank">theek hai</a>", the famed IAC broke up to just become yet another political party, even if it be for the common man, while India rallied for her Damini, the Nirbhaya Amanat symbolised the end of an era; and beginning of another one where the boy child needs to be taken care of. And what else to say when The God himself says its time to hang up the boots.</p>
<p>Yes, the world has ended. Everything that begins has an end; and after every end there is a new beginning. The Mayans never said the circle is broken. Their calendar is a circle. Its just the beginning of a new one. Here is to the brand new year, with all its copy lefts and common creatives; see you tomorrow!</p>
<p>PS: Wishing you all a very happy new year!</p>
