<p>* IANA IPv4 Exhaustion</p>
<p>At a ceremony held on 3 February, 2011 the Internet Assigned<br />
Numbers Authority (IANA) allocated the remaining last five /8s of<br />
IPv4 address space to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) in<br />
accordance with the Global Policy for the Allocation of the<br />
Remaining IPv4 Address Space. With this action, the free pool of<br />
available IPv4 addresses is now fully depleted. To read the full<br />
text of this announcement please go to:</p>

<p>* World IPv6 Day</p>
<p>Facebook, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO), websites<br />
with more than one billion combined visits each day, are joining<br />
major content delivery networks Akamai (NASDAQ: AKAM) and<br />

<p>* IPv6 Deployment Growth<br />
The global IPv6 routing table has passed 4000 IPv6 prefixes.</p>
<p>Of the 36820 networks in the world running BGP, the number running<br />
IPv6 has increased to 3107, or 8.4 percent.</p>
