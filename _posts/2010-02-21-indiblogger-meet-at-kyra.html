<p>okay.. so the bloggers meet at Kyra in bangalore has started..<br />
The meet started with the introduction of the indiblogger team, followed by intro from the various bloggers who have conjured here for the meet.<br />
People bragging about their blogs. People who are good at writing but maybe not all that great a speaker (I am neither :P)<br />
Some people are good at speaking and am sure their writing will be a pleasure to read!</p>
<p>Various people described their blogs in their own words.<br />
But the one description that drew the maximum attention was ..<br />
"I dont have a blog".. Yeah! That was <a href="http://www.indiblogger.in/blogger/23376/">Murali</a>!<br />
Murali is here to learn and be inspired by the nuisance of the bloggers :)</p>
<p>The wide variety of bloggers can still be aggregated withing a range of people writing upon tech, music, personal, poetry, anything and everything and nothing!</p>
<p>While people are busy introducing themselves, the self-professed photographers are busy clicking the meet :)</p>
<p>Lots of tweeples are also here. Notably, Lord Dhempe, tinucherian, ashwinsid, Santhosp, tweepak (and myself :P )</p>
<p>ANd the beer has started to flow :D<br />
That was the introductory post.. more (along with pics ) coming in soon ! :D</p>
