<p>I ve been trying to setup etherpad on my slicehost slice running fedora. I managed to get all the dependencies fulfilled yet it would fail compiling. (I let it run for 36+ hours and then did Ctrl+C when I realised its not really working.) Then I came across the newly released rpm for fedora 12:<br />
<a href="http://sdz.fedorapeople.org/etherpad/"><br />
http://sdz.fedorapeople.org/etherpad/</a></p>
<p>This still is buggy. For example, </p>
<p><code>[root@deltacore etherpad-0]# etherpad-rebuildjar.sh<br />
/usr/bin/etherpad-rebuildjar.sh: line 32: ../infrastructure/bin/compilecache.sh: No such file or directory<br />
</code></p>
<p>Ofcourse, because the original script has just been moved to /usr/bin without even changing the source :!</p>
<p>Anyways, I just tried running the etherpad server and thats when I got my major roadblock :!</p>
<p><code>[root@deltacore etherpad-0]# etherpad-run-local.sh<br />
Using config file: /etc/etherpad.localdev-default.properties<br />
Error occurred during initialization of VM<br />
Could not reserve enough space for object heap<br />
</code><br />
So next, I am gonna run it on my private server with better memory and see how it works.</p>
