<p>So I recentlty bought (or rather booked) my most expensive acquisition so far. A Volkswagen Polo 1.6L. Every dealer in bangalore was quoting a road tax of 15.4%. But no one was able to substantiate it on paper or from the official RTO site. In addition, there was a <a href="http://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/76433-discrepancy-life-time-road-tax-karnataka.html" title="team bhp thread" target="_blank">team-BHP thread</a> where people talked about it being 13% + 10% cess on tax = 14.3% tax total. I also read the same initially, but then found out that the tax is rather 14% (as mentioned in the addendum) and cess 11% (not updated on site but checked with RTO official on phone).</p>
<p>So, if you are here to find out the road tax in karnataka, hit here:</p>

<p>I would ve updated the team BHP thread rather than putting a blog post here but team BHP wont accept my "registration". Your loss team BHP-ians.</p>
