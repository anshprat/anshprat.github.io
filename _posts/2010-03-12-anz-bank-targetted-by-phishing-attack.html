<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand_Banking_Group" target="_blank">ANZ</a> Bank, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ASX: ANZ, NZX: ANZ), commonly called ANZ, is the fourth largest bank in Australia. This bank has recently come under attack by a major phishing attempt. Genuine looking mails are being sent out and these mails even have the proper from and reply to headers.<br />
This looks much more major than the usual spoofy phishing attacks.</p>
<p>This attack makes use of open smtp relay servers like centralfilms.net.</p>
<p>The malicious mails have links pointing to</p>
<p>http://anzspadeace.emenace.com/bankmainanz/bankmain/bankmain/bankmain.asp/cgi-bin/login.htm and<br />
http://anzservicesonline9.emenace.com/bankmainanz/bankmain/bankmain/bankmain.asp/cgi-bin/login.htm</p>
<p>If you get any mail from ANZ (and you have a account with ANZ) do not click on or provide any information in there. Contact your bank immediately.</p>
<p>Sample phishing email:</p>
<p>Hello<br />
As part of our security measures, we regularly monitor the activities in the Bank system. We have recently contacted you in response to a problem with your ANZ Bank account. </p>
<p>Information you have requested for the following reason:<br />

File No: PP-1128-818-425<br />
