<p>This blog post is about my recent switch to Vodafone 3G and related experience. Or just related woes. Experience hasn't been much yet.</p>
<p>Vodafone finally launched 3G in bangalore (I think using Airtel infrastructure).</p>
<p>I had tested BSNL 3G earlier (pretty good) but wasn't ready to make a permanent switch to BSNL (number woes despite MNP). Also am quiet satisfied with Vodafone phone services. </p>
<p>Anyways, after I moved to 3G, I suffered a drastic setback. My calls wont be connected! Not dropped connections, but calls simply wont be connected. After I dial a number, it would just hang up in a matter of minutes. Everytime I would ve to reselect the Operator from the network menu. And somehow, the menu would always show two vodafone (and NO Airtel at all!).</p>
<p>I ve an android phone. And there was no simple way to select manual selection of operator explicitly ( I do miss the good old days of not so smartphones at times!).</p>
<p>I did tweet about my woes and VodafoneIN replied with a complaint number.</p>
<p>And on the sidelines, I found the solution, by mistake..</p>
<p>I selected "Use only 2G Network" and voila! All my calls were being connected at ease like before!</p>
<p>Guess this demonstrates the fact that Vodafone uses 3G using airtel network and since airtel becomes the preferred network, the outgoing calls have some issues.</p>
<p>Will debug more on this later in the week.</p>
