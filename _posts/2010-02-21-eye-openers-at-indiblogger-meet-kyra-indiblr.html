<p>Second in the series on the indiblogger meet at Kyra in Bangalore on February 21, 2010.<br />
This is my second live blogging opportunity. My first live blogging opportunity was way <a href="http://anshprat.wordpress.com/2008/01/23/glug-t-discussion/">baack </a>in college during a meet <a href="http://anshprat.wordpress.com/2008/01/23/the-mayhem-continues/">discussing</a> something for pragyan 08!<br />
Okay, while the introduction continues, the one thing that rather one person that left me speechless for a couple of seconds was the blind blogger! Yes, as the name suggests thats his nick for no small reason. He indeed is blind.<br />
Am speechless. Looking forward to have a conversation with him and then update more over here.</p>
<p>Also, there is this youngest guy over here, who (un)fortunately has been introduced to blogging by a MSIE fan :! :P</p>
