<p>Fedora recently launched <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org" target="_blank">https://badges.fedoraproject.org</a>, a recognition system that awards badges based upon certain activities that you do within the Fedora Infrastructure Environment.</p>
<p>I have recently been working with the Fedora Infrastructure and came to know about the badges. Needless to say I was excited and wanted some of my own.</p>
<p>First step to be a part of the Fedora infrastructure is to have a Fedora Account System account. You can signup for it at <a href="http://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/" target="_blank">http://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have created your account, you should add a secret question to your account. This will earn you <a title="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/riddle-me-this" href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/riddle-me-this" target="_blank">https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/riddle-me-this</a>.</p>

<p>Adding your timezone to your account profile earns you the</p>

<p>By adding your ssh or GPG key to your account, you can earn the <a title="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/crypto-panda" href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/crypto-panda" target="_blank">https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/crypto-panda</a></p>

<p>Accepting the FPCA (Fedora Project Contributor Agreement) earns you the <a title="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/involvement" href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/involvement" target="_blank">https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/involvement</a></p>

<p>To earn the <a title="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/let-me-introduce-myself" href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/let-me-introduce-myself" target="_blank">https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/let-me-introduce-myself</a> , you need to create your User twiki page on the Fedora twiki. Mine is at <a title="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Anshprat" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Anshprat" target="_blank">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Anshprat</a></p>
