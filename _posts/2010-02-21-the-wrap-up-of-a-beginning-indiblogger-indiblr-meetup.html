The <a href="http://indiblogger.in">Indiblogger</a> <a href="http://www.indiblogger.in/bloggermeet.php?id=68">meet</a> at <a href="http://www.kyra.in/">Kyra</a>, bangalore sponsored by <a href="http://www.kingfisherworld.com">Kingfisher</a> was a big hit!<br />
The Kyra Theater was almost all jampacked, with all but few of the the 150 attendees being able to attend it. There were a couple of surprise visits also. I mentioned Murali in my <a href="http://anshprat.info/2010/02/21/indiblogger-meet-at-kyra/">last post</a>, where he said "I am not a blogger". It so turned out that there were a couple of more people who were not bloggers but had tagged along with their blogger friends. Hope these guys get started with blogging soon!</p>

<p>Ok, now about two of the people about whom I mentioned in the last post.<br />
First, the eye opener, the blind blogger who is just visually impaired - <a href="http://www.indiblogger.in/blogger/22171/">Raaghav </a>.<br />
This guy is a role model for people. Not just for visually  impaired but for everyone!</p>
<p>The other one is Vivek, the youngest blogger out there in the meetup :)</p>
<p>Well, as always, time flies when its good times!<br />
Before long it was 6 and we had to get out of Kyra!<br />
Thanks a zillion to kingfisher, Kyra and the indiblogger team for the meetup!</p>
<p>Things to do: To write a about us page for the indiblogger team :D as a token of thanks and appreciation! </p>
<p>It was great meeting him and I hope to know and meet him more and then write up more about him!</p>
<p>Then there was this elderly person with <a href="http://www.indiblogger.in/indirank/">Indirank</a> 79! He had great words of wisdoms about blogging and also about indirank :P<br />
Apparently "too many posts in a day to your blog are counted as null" by the indirank! :!</p>
