<p>This post is just a conjunction of my thoughts, my beliefs. I don't know why but ever since I came to know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">2012 phenomenon</a>, I ve been an astute believer in it. I am no believer in conspiracy theory. But somehow when I hear all the happenings around, and by that I mean mostly the actual natural disasters, some of which are man caused (the BP oil spill, the various disasters). The volcano erupting out of iceland. The flash floods. The rising temperatures. The floods in Europe. </p>
<p>I'll be posting more of my thoughts on this, all under the tag 2012.</p>
