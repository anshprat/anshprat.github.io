<p>Well, for the last few weeks I ve been seeing this error quite often on my blog. I didn't think of it much initially as it used to go away on a mysql restart. However, today I ran into it and was persistent after mysql restarts. So I started digging a bit more and enabled debugging in wp-config</p>
<p><code><br />
in wp-config.php</code></p>
<p>define('WP_DEBUG', true);<br />
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', true);</p>
<p>This didn't show any error that could help me. I could ve tried enabling further logging in apache to see if that helps</p>

<p>I had tried logging into mysql with the username and password configured in the wordpress config and it worked fine. So I knew those were fine and mysql was running fine. I even restarted httpd a few times to confirm, but it didnt help either.</p>
<p>Then I checked up the mysqld log and voila!</p>

<p>So looks like this is what was causing my recent problems.</p>
<p>Once I saw this in the mysql logs, it was a simple fix:</p>
<p><code><br />
mysql&gt; repair table wp_options;</code></p>
<p>Found 231 of 230 rows when repairing wp_options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so far its all been good after that :)</p>
