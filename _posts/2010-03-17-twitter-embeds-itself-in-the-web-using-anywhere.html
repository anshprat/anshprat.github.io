<p>@anywhere, as it is known, will allow people using websites such as Amazon or the New York Times to follow new users or share media directly from the page. </p>
<p>It was unveiled at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. </p>
<p>It is similar to Facebook's Connect service that allows people to log in to other websites using their Facebook details and interact with friends. </p>
<p>"Imagine being able to follow a New York Times journalist directly from her byline, tweet about a video without leaving YouTube, and discover new Twitter accounts while visiting the Yahoo home page," Twitter said on its blog. </p>
<p>'Different approach'</p>
<p>The social network has not said when the service will launch, but said that it had already partnered with YouTube, Microsoft Bing and eBay amongst others.</p>
<p>Developers can already add Twitter functionality to their sites using a so-called API (application programming interface). </p>
<p>APIs are a set of tools offered by a firm to allow people outside the company to access and manipulate data held about their users. </p>
<p>They have become increasingly common amongst web firms to extend their reach beyond their own website. </p>
<p>Twitter said that @anywhere was a "different approach" that would be simpler for many sites to use. </p>
<p>This "open" approach to third-party developers allowed Twitter to grow at a phenomenal rate in its early days. </p>
<p>Recent data shows that traffic to Twitter's websites has levelled off since the middle of 2009. </p>
<p>However, measurements of Twitter use is very difficult as many users interact with the service through desktop software and mobile phones.</p>
