<p>UPDATE: And now I have moved (back) to firefox 4! Firefox 4 is fast, so far no crashes and is looking good. more on this later as I spend more time on it!</p>
<p>hi,</p>
<p>First and foremost a little into what this post will give you. In this post, first I talk a little about why I need this post. Then a little of my browsing habbits history. Then some of my problems. And then my problems.</p>
<p>This post started when I realised I ve been switching between browsers one after another whenever I face some issue with one. Now few months down the lane, I don't remember what the problem was and why I switched away from a particular browser and to what and why. So this post is more like a little documentation effort.</p>
<p>Now a little into my browser usage history. As a kid I remember using IE, Firefox and a little of Opera. In college, I was primarily a firefox user (with a little bit of elinks thrown in whenever the network would be clogged down). After I started work, one of the worst versions of firefox was released. FF 3.0. It would crash like a drunken dog gone nuts on the roads. I switched over to Opera at this instance after suffering for weeks (on fedora). Then I switched to Mac. My love for Opera continued. Ofcourse I have firefox with firebug and webdeveloper and various profiles. And then, I guess it started crashing for some reasons. I tried safari but wasn't really impressed. At this time I primarily switched to Chrome. I had tried chromium on fedora earlier and Chrome had evolved a lot from its chromium days.</p>
<p>At the moment, am back to Opera. This post is being published in Opera. And the reason. Well, the latest version of Chrome is buggy or maybe its the speeddial extension. Now when I click on any speeddial, the speeddial opens up, but the address bar is empty :!</p>
<p>And its hightime I try Opera 11 :)<br />
In the meanwhile, I ll be downloading latest firefox nightly release aka minefield :)</p>
<p>And will keep this post (or further posts) as a part of documenting my waddle through the various browsers. (IE wont be part much of it, though I do use it once in a while owing to some stupid IE rich web applications.).</p>
<p>More on it later. Cheers<br />
