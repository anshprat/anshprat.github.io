<p>The early morning of June 11th (or June 10 evening for the folks in US west coast) saw wordpress.com going down! This is the first time that I remember such a big outage ever since I started with wordpress. It was just giving an error message saying "Wordpress will be back shortly!". Millions of blogs hosted on wordpress were affected because of this. Also non-wordpress hosted blogs using wordpress were affected for their stats. As the stats plugin uses API keys issued by wordpress.<br />

<p>Majority of wordpress blogs <a href="http://twitter.com/wordpressdotcom/statuses/15894086659" target="_blank">are up now</a> and rest are slowly crawling back to normalcy. The main site is yet to be restored.</p>
