<p>I am kinda late to the mobile blogging scene, owing to slow gprs speed, missing 3g connection and a mobile device with wifi connection (well I had the ipad for about 6 months now but guess I was lazy). So now that I ve 3g on my nexus s (not to forget wifi on it as well) , I ve now installed <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=org.wordpress.android" target="_blank">WordPress for android</a> on it. I can immediately see the pros n cons of it. Pros - blogging on the move.Â  Cons - the linking to other pages etc would be more cumbersome as you can't just open a tab, copy a link and paste. A big major pros is the auto suggest and auto correct that you get on all mobile phones. Well... I guess am gonna be happy about it... </p>
<p>UPDATE: I opened the post in my laptop browser to add the android marketplaces link. Guess, mobile blogging will take sometime before its my first choice. I ll try it from my ipad as well. Somehow it appears as if thats gonna be more intuitive.</p>
