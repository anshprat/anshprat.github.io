<p>So by now you must have heard about the Yahoo! India layoff of October 2014 where they are "laying" off everyone but the operations. Well, here is what is happening:</p>
<p>Most of the development teams have already been shifted to US. Most of the remaining development teams in India have been given an offer to move to US. And most of them have accepted the offer. In all about 600 developers have been asked to leave while about 300 of the remaining folks have been given an offer for US relocation.</p>
<p>The folks who have been given US offer are mostly being offered a four months severance package if they choose not to accept the offer. Other folks who have not been given an offer to move have been given similar severance package. The severance package differs across teams and ranks.</p>
<p>The operations team (what Yahoo! used to call Service Engineering Organisation) which falls in the realm of the now famous devops have mostly not been given an offer to move nor have they been asked to leave. However they have not been offered any retention package either, showing that the company is not too keen to keep them around but rather would be glad if they leave on their own (and most of them are already planning to).</p>
<p>The day started with a mail calling everyone to a meeting in the morning. All of the managers were already briefed about the move earlier in the day (previous evening?). The individuals were intimated about the offer for them (whether they are being given an offer to move or whether they are being let go) separately.</p>
<p>As per an <a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/yahoo-confirms-bangalore-office-restructuring-refuses-comment-on-extent-of-reported-layoffs-603190" target="_blank">official email</a> from Yahoo! to media..</p>
<p>"As we ensure that Yahoo is on a path of sustainable growth, we're looking at ways to achieve greater efficiency, collaboration and innovation across our business," Prachi Singh, Manager and Lead, Corporate Communications, Yahoo (India) said in an email statement. "To this effect, we're making some changes to the way we operate in Bangalore leading to consolidation of certain teams into fewer offices. Yahoo will continue to have a presence in India and Bangalore remains an important office."</p>
<p>The most important lesson out of this change has been the missing leaks. Its been a while since any leaks of such news have come from Yahoo!. There was once a time when Yahoo!s would read a news outside first before hearing about it internally. That has definitely changed.</p>
<p>Atleast something is going good for Yahoo!s.</p>
