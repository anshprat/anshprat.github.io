How to setup dns in slicehost?<br />
Create the dns for your primary domain name using the setup as provided by <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/10/24/creating-dns-records">slicehost</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have a proper working domain name configured on your slicehost,<br />
to add a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain">sub-domain</a>,</p>
<p>login to <a href="http://manage.slicehost.com">slicehost admin</a><br />
Go to DNS tab.<br />
Click on records next to your domain name.<br />
Create a new record<br />
Type A<br />
Name yourSubdomain.  <-- Note the last (dot). its compulsory<br />
Data - your ip address to where you want to point your subdomain to. Most probably you want it to point to your slicehost ip itself.<br />
change TTL if you want to.<br />
Create record.<br />
Done!<br />
Now you have yourSubdomain.yourDomain up and running.</p>
<p>PS: Am assuming you are using your slicehost dns as your primary dns. </p>
