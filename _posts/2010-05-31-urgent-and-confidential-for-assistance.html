<p>Dearest One.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your response to my message, I appreciate your kind gesture to find time to give reponse to my message to you. First and foremost and brief self introduction,I am Jannifer Jean Kekouri,24years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr.and Mrs. Jean Kekouri.</p>
<p>My father was a highly reputable busnness magnate-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory Coast during his days It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Feb. 2003.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.But God knows the truth!</p>
<p>My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12- 2007 he called me and disclose to me that he had a sum of $4.5 million US DOLLARS (Four Million Five hundred thousand USD) deposited  with one of the local banks here in Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>He also said he used my name as his next of kin to the fund with the bank as his only daughter, as well as the next of kin. He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business assocaites, That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money to and use it for investment purposes. I want you to assist me in clearing this fund into your account overseas as a beneficiary of the fund,and also use it for an investment purpose. </p>
<p>I am just 25 years old and a high school and really don't know what to do.Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Dearest one,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.</p>
<p>Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 1. Can you honestly help me?<br />
2. Can I completely trust you?<br />
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after the money is in your account? </p>
<p>Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible, as well I will like you to reply to me with your private email address if you are willing to have the relevant documents to confirm the existence of the fund for verification from the bank and to confirm the authenticity of my proposal to you also for easy communication. </p>
