<a href="http://slicehost.com" target="_blank">Slicehost</a>, the webhost on which this blog is hosted have upgraded their basic slice features starting February 17, 2010. Now for a monthly charge of $20, you get 150GB of bandwidth. It was earlier 100GB per month. Similarly all other slices have been upgraded. Also they have introduced new slice sizes, which in their <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/articles/2010/2/17/new-slice-sizes-price-changes-and-bandwidth-increases" target="_blank">own words<br />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
to help with a smoother, more consistent upgrade path we are very pleased to offer our new 'Intermediate Slices'. They sit nicely between our most popular Slice sizes. We have introduced a 384Slice, a 768Slice, a 1.5GB Slice and a 3GB Slice.</p>
<p>The prices of the new Slices will also allow for an easier resize path - the new Slices start at just $25.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, slicehost now have started "Professional Services", which basically mean you pay them and they do whatever you want :)<br />
The upgrades are in effect immediately. You can see your upgraded bandwidths at your <a href="http://manage.slicehost.com" target="_blank">slicehost manager</a></p>
