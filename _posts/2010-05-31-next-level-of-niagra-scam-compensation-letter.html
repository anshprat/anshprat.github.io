<p>In the next level of Niagra scam, the scammer no longer talks about any accident or crash or any misfortune that happened. Instead straight forward he goes away telling he is sorry that the last fund transfer attempt failed. You should contact his secretary to try it all out again. lol.</p>
<p>=====================================</p>
<p>THIS IS A SCAM. DO NOT EVER REPLY TO SUCH EMAILS!</p>

Compensation Letter from Mr Musa Issaka</p>
<p>ATT: GOOD FRIEND,</p>
<p>I'm sorry but happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from London though I tried my best to involve you in the business but God decided the whole situations. Presently I’m in London for investment projects with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.</p>
<p>Now contact my secretary in Burkina Faso her name is Mrs. Demba Narus on her e-mail address below (demba_nerus2006@w.cn) ask him to send you the total of $4.8m, which I kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated all your efforts at that time very much.<br />
So feel free and get in touched with my secretary Mrs. Demba Narus and instruct him where to send the amount to you.</p>
<p>Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy after all the suffer ness at that time. In the moment, I’m very busy here because of the investment projects which I and the new partner are having at hand, finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with Mrs. Demba Narus. She will send the amount to you without any delay.</p>
<p>Regards.<br />
Mr. Musa Issaka</p>
